# Differential-Equations-Solution
This repositry includes analytical solution to various differential equations.
There are three problems whose solutions has been provided in this repository:

Problem_1: Suppose that the mass in a mass-spring-dashpot system
with m = 10, c = 9, and k = 2 is set in motion with x(0) =
0 and x'(0) = 5. Find the position function x(t).
